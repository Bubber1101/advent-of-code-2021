My attempt at Advent Of Code 2021

I'll use it as a playground to get to know the [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

[Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
